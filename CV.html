					<h2>Profile</h2>
					<p>

					Dublin with an Honours Degree in Computing Science. I have 
					made several small software applications during my time in
					College that were for personal learning and experience. I am 
					open to criticism, and I can use the feedback to improve my 
					role in the organization and in future projects.

					<h2>Achievements</h2>
					<p>
						During my time working in the Irish National Stud in 2017, on days with many incoming customers, I had to direct cars to the three parking areas with no staff or security to aid me. Through careful placement of vehicles and knowledge of how much space was available, I was able to ensure that customers would be able to park and enter the tourist grounds. I was later informed that through my actions, I had helped the stud make a turnover larger than the season of 2016.
